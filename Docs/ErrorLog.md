## 2026-05-06 - CurrentTask Drift

Context:
Feature implementation continued while `Docs/CurrentTask.md` still described the old project memory system task.

Cause:
The document was treated as required reading but not as an actively maintained task contract.

Fix:
Update `Docs/CurrentTask.md` at the start of each active task change, and keep detailed progress in `Docs/SessionLogs/`.

Prevention:
Before implementation, confirm `CurrentTask.md` matches the user's current requested work. If it does not, update it first.
